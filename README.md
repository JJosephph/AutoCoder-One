## Project Overview

**AI-Driven Full-Stack Code Generation Framework** is an advanced software development platform leveraging state-of-the-art AI models (including Claude4 and customizable local models) to generate backend business logic, API interfaces, and frontend UI components automatically from existing database schemas and high-level business requirements.

Unlike traditional tools like MyBatis-Plus which provide fixed CRUD scaffolding, this framework features:

- Dynamic system design integration supporting product- or project-defined workflows and functions.
- Intelligent schema validation and evolution with user-interactive suggestions or automated schema modification.
- Multi-model AI support with pluggable backends: cloud-based paid models, free public models, or user-hosted local models.
- Full-stack code generation including annotated Java Spring Boot + MyBatis backend, microservice modules, and frontend pages with Element-UI, Ant Design, ECharts, or custom imported UI components.
- Comprehensive auto-generated documentation: REST API specs, deployment guides, and testing plans.
- Iterative AI-assisted development enabling continuous refinement and feature addition.

## Key Features

- **Automated Full-Stack Generation:** End-to-end code and UI generation directly from database schema + business requirements.
- **Schema Analysis & Evolution:** Intelligent validation, suggestions, and automated or manual schema modifications.
- **Multi-Model AI Integration:** Support for Claude4, OpenAI, local AI models with API key management.
- **UI Framework Selection & Custom UI Import:** Choose popular component libraries or bring your own UI templates.
- **Pre-Integrated Frontend & Backend:** Auto-linked APIs and UI components with detailed inline code comments.
- **Deployment & Maintenance Docs:** Auto-generated ready-to-use deployment, startup, and maintenance documentation.
- **Security & Performance Best Practices:** Built-in OAuth2, JWT, encryption, caching, and asynchronous processing.
